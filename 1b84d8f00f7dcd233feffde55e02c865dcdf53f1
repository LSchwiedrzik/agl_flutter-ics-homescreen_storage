      "message": "treat dart defines like a #define.  Is you want to pass an environmental variable, this is outside of flutter-auto, Meaning the environment is not modified by flutter-auto, dart will use the same environment as flutter-auto. you can add multiple environment lines in the service file.  So multiple files can affect the runtime environment.",

      "message": "Thanks. It is clear that I\u0027m am missing a lot of \"subtle\" differences between dart/flutter and the rest of the (*nix, at least) world. Indeed, if I choose to create a Linux app when running `flutter run` the binary that gets created acts as if it had a build-time define and not en environment variable. So the API is misleading at least, unless the meaning of \"environment\" has been changed for dart/flutter.\n\nNon the less this change suits devs perfectly, as we can avoid them modifying harcoded values. A suitable solution for flutter-auto will still be needed though. I\u0027ll leave that to real Flutter devs ðŸ˜Š",
